<p>For over 20 years, I have developed a relationship with fear, vulnerability, power, permission, unconditional confidence...what it means to use yourself&nbsp;as an instrument for performing. I have forged a self and an identity by becoming an Actor and it has provided me a lens into the world as an Artist and a storyteller. Sometimes I&rsquo;m successful. Sometimes I&rsquo;m not. The one true constant however is that the path of any performer is through a process of learning and experiencing.</p>

<p>I was not the star pupil in my theatre department. I did not have parents who encouraged me to audition for Julliard or who could have afforded to send me to Yale, but I managed to buid an&nbsp;education from extraordinary teachers because I was hungry to learn. I knew in my core what I wanted and&nbsp;I sought angels, allies, guides and champions. Whenever I work on a new project, I enter a new conversation with artists who inspire and teach me. It is my hope to continue this conversation within the Process Artist Lab. I consider my work&nbsp;as if I were in an empty park and bit by bit, the landscape is being populated with the most beautiful species of flora and fauna.</p>

<p>Extraordinary teachers are hard to find. They teach with compassion, without personal agenda and they share the best part of themselves and their knowledge. The Process Artist Lab grew out of&nbsp;my blog &ldquo;The Process&rdquo; as a desire to create a space for people who wish to be in an artistic exploration of&nbsp;the work. Teachers in this lab&nbsp;are highly accomplished professionals interested in sharing&nbsp;their knowledge and experiences through small master classes, workshops and salons. They come from acting, filmmaking, writing, performing and more. Students can be anyone hungry to learn.<br />
<br />
Another evolving component of P.A.L. is the outreach program designed to provide underprivileged youth free access to the same&nbsp;resources mentioned above. Our hope is to work with larger networks such as schools or diverse&nbsp;communities so that the Arts can be used in the same way I experienced it growing up, as a means of finding one&#39;s voice and empowering oneself to create a narrative for storytelling and personal growth.<br />
<br />
Welcome to P.A.L.</p>

<h2>SPARKING THE GAPS: ACTING AT THE THRESHOLD OF SEEING</h2>

<blockquote>&quot;But there is another kind of seeing that involves a letting go. . . When I see this way I see truly. As Thoreau says, I return to my senses.&quot;
<p>--Annie Dillard, from Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can your imagination become so powerful that you transform a stage or film set into your own rich, working environment?</p>

<p>How can you become one of those actors who &#39;changes the space&#39; through your work?</p>

<p>How can you become free from self-consciousness and distraction in cold reads and auditions?</p>

<p>Learn to build images and work with space as reliable partners for auditions and all acting work. This workshop will explore how to see imagery in our work, how seeing forms and shapes our breath and text, and how relying on seeing with spatial accuracy, fluidity, and energetic fullness can immediately free and deepen our acting. This work is particularly useful for helping performers find trust in &lsquo;doing less&rsquo; while paradoxically filling the frame with much nuance, intensity, and depth.</p>

<p>Each participant should bring a 1 - 1 1/2 minute monologue to work on during the weekend. Through exercises, Andy will initiate this practice of imagination work, i.e. seeing, stimulation, sensation, kinesthetic and breath response with individual actors. He will work with each student to help locate their own personal patterns as related to seeing, the breath and physicality. All levels are welcome.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 cushycms"><h2>AREAS OF OUR WORK INCLUDE:</h2>

<h4>Seeing with the whole self.</h4>

<p>Developing the practice of seeing as a source of stimulation, and an important engine for action, character, and desire. Working from the understanding that we see with our brain/body (the whole self), we practice seeing first with the eyes, and expand to seeing with the ears, the kinesthetic or &#39;felt&#39; self, and energy centers. Learn to engage more of you in seeing.</p>

<h4>Image as stimulation: responding from the active image-ination.</h4>

<p>Learning to deeply engage with imagery in our bodies, merging with images, and allowing responses in our breathing, emotion, thinking, and perception. This work opens new directions in text that we might not otherwise find.</p>

<h4>Multi-directional space.</h4>

<p>Expanding the practice of seeing from/through the body into the entire space in specific directions. Creating maps of the spaces and directions of seeing images in ways that render a monologue or text into reliable physical environment. As we learn a capacity to express ourselves multi-directionally, our work gains depth, bringing the unseen and specificity into our work. We learn to sense the directional energies alive in resonant spaces between our selves and others/things/images/events.</p>
