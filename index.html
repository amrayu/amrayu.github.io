                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>For over 20 years, I have developed a relationship with fear, vulnerability, physical and mental habits, expressivity, power, permission…what it means to use myself as an instrument for performing.  I have forged a Self and an identity by becoming an Actor and it has provided me a lens into the world by being a storyteller. Sometimes I’m successful. Sometimes I’m not. The one true constant however is that the path of the performing artist is a process.</p>
                <p>It has taken many turns in the road to learn and accept this.</p>
                <p>I was not the star pupil in my theatre department. I didn’t have parents who encouraged me to pursue Julliard or who could afford to send me to Yale. I only knew I wanted to act. I had dreams and instincts. The need to perform was deeply embedded in my core and as a result I sought teachers, champions, allies, angels and guides. God knows I needed them, and I was ferocious about learning. I could not have done it without teachers.</p>
                <p>Extraordinary teachers are hard to find. They teach with compassion, without personal agenda and they share the best part of themselves and their knowledge. It is my hope to create a lab where students can learn from working professionals through master classes, intensives and salons. This space is a safe harbor for all actors, directors, writers, creative artists and storytellers to learn, play and be in process.</p>

                    <h2>SPARKING THE GAPS: ACTING AT THE THRESHOLD OF SEEING</h2>
                    <blockquote>"But there is another kind of seeing that involves a letting go. . . When I see this way I see truly. As Thoreau says, I return to my senses."</blockquote>
                    <p>--Annie Dillard, from Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</p>
                    <p>How can your imagination become so powerful that you transform a stage or film set into your own rich, working environment?</p>
                    <p>How can you become one of those actors who ‘changes the space’ through your work?</p>
                    <p>How can you become free from self-consciousness and distraction in cold reads and auditions?</p>
                    <p>Learn to build images and work with space as reliable partners for auditions and all acting work.  This workshop will explore how to see imagery in our work, how seeing forms and shapes our breath and text, and how relying on seeing with spatial accuracy, fluidity, and energetic fullness can immediately free and deepen our acting. This work is particularly useful for helping performers find trust in ‘doing less’ while paradoxically filling the frame with much nuance, intensity, and depth.</p>
                    <p>Each participant should bring a 1 - 1 1/2  minute monologue to work on during the weekend. Through exercises, Andy will initiate this practice of imagination work, i.e. seeing, stimulation, sensation, kinesthetic and breath response with individual actors. He will work with each student to help locate their own personal patterns as related to seeing, the breath and physicality. All levels are welcome.</p>
